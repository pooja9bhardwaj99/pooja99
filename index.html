<b><h2>Introduction to cloud computing</h2></b>
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the Cloud (Internet).Cloud Computing provides an alternative to the on premises datacentre. With an on-premises datacentre, we have to manage everything, such as purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization, installing the operating system, and any other required applications, setting up the network, configuring the firewall, and setting up storage for data. After doing all the set-up, we become responsible for maintaining it through its entire lifecycle.

<p>
But if we choose Cloud Computing, a cloud vendor is responsible for the hardware purchase and maintenance. They also provide a wide variety of software and platform as a service. We can take any required services on rent. The cloud computing services will be charged based on usage.

The cloud environment provides an easily accessible online portal that makes handy for the user to manage the compute, storage, network, and application resources. Some cloud service providers are in the following figure.

<b><h2>Advantages of cloud computing</h2></b>
<b>Cost:</b> It reduces the huge capital costs of buying hardware and software.<br><b>Speed:</b> Resources can be accessed in minutes, typically within a few clicks.<br><b>Scalability:</b> We can increase or decrease the requirement of resources according to the business requirements.<br><b>Productivity:</b> While using cloud computing, we put less operational effort. We do not need to apply patching, as well as no need to maintain hardware and software. So, in this way, the IT team can be more productive and focus on achieving business goals.<br><b>Reliability:</b> Backup and recovery of data are less expensive and very fast for business continuity.<br><b>Security:</b>Many cloud vendors offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen our data security.<br><br>

<b><h2>Types of cloud computing</h2></b>There are four different cloud models that you can subscribe according to business needs. Following are the different Types of Clouds:

<p>
<b> <h4>1. Private Cloud</h4></b> A private cloud is provided to a single organization rather than the general public. It offers the same advantages of scalability, resource utilization, and self-service as the public cloud, but is provided in a data center operated either by the organization itself or a third party. Here, computing resources are deployed for one particular organization. This method is more used for intra-business interactions.  Where the computing resources can be governed, owned and operated by the same organization.<br><b> <h4>2. Community Cloud</h4></b> The community cloud is a recent variation of public cloud that provides a cloud platform for specific business communities. It is particularly useful for highly-regulated industries like health care, financial, or legal entities with a strong need to share resources. Here, computing resources are provided for a community and organizations.<br><b> <h4>3. Public Cloud</h4></b> A public cloud is the provision of computing services over the public Internet. Public cloud services are usually sold on-demand and help companies avoid the high cost of purchasing and maintaining an on-premise data center. This type of cloud is used usually for B2C (Business to Consumer) type interactions. Here the computing resource is owned, governed and operated by government, an academic or business organization.<br><b> <h4>4. Hybrid Cloud</h4></b> Hybrid deployments are a combination of on-premise, private cloud, and third-party public cloud services. Resources are orchestrated between the two clouds by management and automation software. This type of cloud can be used for both type of interactions -  B2B (Business to Business) or B2C ( Business to Consumer). This deployment method is called hybrid cloud as the computing resources are bound together by different clouds.<br><br>

<b><h2>Cloud Computing Services</h2></b>
The three major Cloud Computing Offerings are<br>													
</p>																									
																   
<p>
1. Software as a Service (SaaS)<br>
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)<br>
3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)<br>
Different business use some or all of these components according to their requirement.</p><br>

<p>
<b><h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b></h4>
</p>
																										
<p>																	
SaaS is far and away the most common model of cloud service: Companies buy access to an application but have no responsibility for (and no control over) its implementation. More than 60% of companies that Nemertes works with already use at least one (and often several ) applications that they get via SaaS, ranging from horizontally useful tools such as customer relationship management (as with Salesforce.com) to more vertically specific tools for such tasks as insurance claims adjustment, classroom scheduling and medical billing management.

<p>
<b><h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4></b>
</p>																
																		
<p>
PaaS involves providing a platform on which a customer can run its own applications. For example, a small company might have a Java application to which it has trouble providing enough resources during holiday peak loads. The company might go to a platform provider, such as Akamai, to run the system on its Java application server framework. Microsoft, Force.com and Google also provide platforms on which customers can run applications.

<p>
<b><h4>Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)</h4></im></b>
</p>	
																										
<p>
IaaS allows an organization to run entire data center application stacks, from the operating system up to the application, on a service provider's infrastructure. Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud is perhaps the most famous public cloud infrastructure available.

<b><h2>Computing Architecture</h2></b>
Cloud Computing Architecture is a combination of components required for a Cloud Computing service. A Cloud computing architecture consists of several components like a front-end platform, a back-end platform or servers, a network or internet service, and a cloud based delivery service.
Letâ€™s have a look into Cloud Computing and see what Cloud Computing is made of. Cloud computing comprises of two components front end and back end.  Front end consist client part of cloud computing system. It comprise of interfaces and applications that are required to access the Cloud Computing or Cloud Programming platform.</p><br>

</center><br>
																				   
<p> While back end refers to the cloud itself, it comprises of the resources that are required for cloud computing services. It consists of virtual machines, servers, data storage, security mechanism etc. It is under providers control.<br>Cloud computing distributes the file system that spreads over multiple hard disks and machines. Data is never stored in one place only and in case one unit fails the other will take over automatically. The user disk space is allocated on the distributed file system, while another important component is algorithm for resource allocation. Cloud computing is a strong distributed environment and it heavily depends upon strong algorithm.
